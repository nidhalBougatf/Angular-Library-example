# Angular Library Exmaple
  - The main goal is to build an angular application that interacts with a FireBase server.
  - Most of Angular basics were applied here. In addition, some interactions with the firebase services were added, to illustrate its different features ( Authentification, File upload, Data saving/fetching ...)

# Project description

	- list all the books ( Save/Get the list of the books to/from the sever )
